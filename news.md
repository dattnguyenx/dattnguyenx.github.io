<!-- As a PhD candidate, on the way of just solving a small bug in the code to trying to come up with an entirely new algorithm, I've been autonomous learning and studying everyday. I will try to give a record of whatever I read/saw and can recommend on specific topics. I found them extremely helpful for myself for later lookup and I hope that it may also help anyone interested. Most stuff will be about point cloud/video/image procesing, machine learning/deep learning, as my job is related to these topics. Besides, I might add also some posts related to my daily lifes. -->



**News:**
* **October 2024** - I'll be in Abu Dhabi, UAE to present our work at ICIP 2024 conference.
* **September 2024** - I attended the Heidelberg Laureate Forum 2024—an unforgettable experience marked by inspiring conversations with laureates like Pat Hanrahan and Leslie Lamport on computer science and research careers.
* **May 2023** - I'll be in Rhodes island, Greece to present our work at ICASSP 2023 conference.
* **April 2023** - My internship at Meta has come to an end. I really enjoy the time working at Meta with an incredible team full of brilliant people. My main contribution is building an algorithm that adapts the resolution of a mesh to the camera viewpoint. The algorithm significantly reduces the number of triangles being rendered and thus increases FPS without visible distortions.
* **Febuary 2023** - Good News! Our paper entitled "Deep probabilistic model for lossless scalable point cloud attribute compression" has been accepted for presentation at the International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing 2023 (ICASSP 2023).  
* **December 2022** - I'll be joining Meta Reality Labs in Redmond, USA as a Research Scientist Intern starting in January 2023. 
* **December 2022** - Good News! Our work on joint point cloud geometry and attribute compression has been accepted to the IEEE T-CSVT journal. The paper went through 2 rounds of peer review which took approximately 7 months. 
* **November 2022** - I have a submission at the IEEE ICASSP 2023 which will take place in the Greek island of Rhodes from June 04 to June 09, 2023.
* **November 2022** - The first EmpkinS' winter school is hosted in the beautiful city - Hintertux, Austria.
* **October 2022** - I am attending and presenting our work at the IEEE ICIP 2022 in Bordeaux, France.
* **June 2022** - I'll be presenting my first work as a PhD entitled "Learning-based Lossless Point Cloud Geometry Coding using Sparse Tensors" at the IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP 2022), 16-19 October 2022 Bordeaux, France.
* **May 2022** - A manuscript submitted at IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology - one of the top journals in image/video/high-diemnsional data processing.
* **Feb 2022** - I recently accepted an internship offer at Meta Reality Labs (Facebook) which starts in December 2022. I'll be working on Point Clouds, Mesh Compression for immersive applications (VR, AR, ...).
