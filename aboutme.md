I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Chair of Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing (LMS)](https://www.lms.tf.fau.eu/) at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (FAU), Germany. My research lies at the intersection of neural compression, generative models, and 3D data processing, with a specialization in point cloud data. I am expected to complete my Ph.D. by July 2025.

In early 2023, I interned as a Research Scientist at Meta Reality Labs, where I developed dynamic level-of-detail algorithms for real-time 3D rendering. Prior to that, I worked on point cloud compression as both a Master's intern and a Research Engineer at [CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/), France, from September 2020 to May 2021.

I earned my Master’s degree in Multimedia Networking from [Télécom Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en) (Université Paris-Saclay), in 2020.
